# Shadow
The ultimate trolling client for minecraft.


## About
Well for about the last year of my life i've been updating this client, Through this project I basically went from 0 java experience to knowing how to code advanced minecraft exploits.
This client has been private since 12/07/2020, but not anymore, thanks to a old friend of mine deciding he was angry against me and deciding to leaking the client, it's finally public!

Recently, The client had been refactored over to coffee client, so not much of my original work remains (althought most of the exploits do!), so I'd like to give a huge thanks to my friend (0x150)[https://github.com/0x3c50]
